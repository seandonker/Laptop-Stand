C++ code and CAD files for a laptop cooling stand featuring PWM fan control, and RGB lighting all controlled through a simple GUI with a rotary encoder. 
This project was completed in February 2021. The uploaded CAD files are hopefully viewable in solidworks as I was unable to check since I no longer 
have a student solidworks license. The model was originally designed in Onshape and the workspace should also hopefully be visible in the link below.

Unfortuantly for this project, I did not create a circuit schematic (or it's hiding somewhere on my computer). However, it is not a complicated design,
just needing GPIO pins for the RGB LEDs, encoder, and the PWM signal while I2C data lines were needed for the OLED display.
